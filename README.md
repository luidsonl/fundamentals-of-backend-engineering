# Fundamentals of Backend Engineering

This repository contains projects inspired by the concepts taught in the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols/).

These projects are my own implementations created to practice and deepen the topics covered in the course.
